# A Deep Learning Architecture for Metabolic Pathway Prediction

This code is an implementation of our graph-convolutional network (GCN) and random forest (RF) classifiers for predicting one or many metabolic pathway classes for a query compound (paper accepted at Bioinformatics, Oxford University Press).

We use SMILES representation of query molecules to generate relevant fingerprints, which are then fed to the GCN/RF architecture for producing binary labels corresponding to each of the 11 metabolic pathway classes. The details of the GCN and RF architectures are described in our paper (currently under review).

A dataset of 6669 compounds (4935 unique compounds) belonging to one or more of these 11 constituent pathway classes was downloaded (February 2019) from the KEGG database: https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html. We used keggpuller.py to download the dataset. All scripts pertaining to multi-label classification are available in the *multi-class* directory.

We also obtained a dataset with a single classification category that includes 4,539 unique compounds. Subsequently, we created a distinct model specifically for the single-class classification task. You can find the scripts for this model in the *single-class* directory.

### Requirements
* PyTorch
* scikit-learn
* RDKit
* Jupyter Notebook

### Usage
* For multi-label classification, we provide two notebook files, one each for the multi-class GCN classifier and the multi-class ML classifiers. The notebooks are self-sufficient and various relevant details have been marked in the files themselves.
* For single-class classification, we provide two notebook files: *data_handling.ipynb* to prepare the dataset, and *train_models.ipynb* to create and train GCN and Random Forest classifiers.
### Acknowledgements
Part of the code was adopted from [2], and suitably modified for the pathway prediction task.
